<h3>CRICKET:</h3>
<center>
<p><em>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. </p></em>

<h3>Academy:</h3>
<center>
<p><em>The National Cricket Academy is a cricket facility of the BCCI for the purpose of developing young cricketers who have been identified as having the potential to represent the Indian cricket team. It was established in the year 2000 and is located in Chinnaswamy Cricket Stadium, Bengaluru, Karnataka in India. The facility is also used for the rehabilitation of injured players.In 2014, BCCI tied up with both Cricket Australia and the ECB to get experts in for helping draw its new structure. BCCI decided to make these changes along the lines of the state-of-the-art high-performance centres based in Australia and England as part of the revamp of the National Cricket Academy.
In the new plan the NCA has a tie-up with the MRF Pace Foundation to train the fast bowlers from across the country.</p></em>
